## Usage
0. Download the artifact from [releases](https://github.com/etolbakov/excalidocker-rs/releases) and ungzip it. 
To get the `help` menu use:
```sh
./excalidocker -h
```
![release-artifact-output](./data/img/release-artifact-output.png)
The application should be provided with two parameters: 
 - `--input-path` :  `docker-compose.yaml` file path that you would like to convert 
 - `--output-path` : file path for the output excalidraw file. By default a file is be stored under "/tmp/<docker-compose-file-name>.excalidraw"


To see the tool in action use:
```sh
./excalidocker --input-path /your/path/docker-compose.yaml --output-path /your/path/result.excalidraw
```
The produced file could be opened in [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and.... hopefully it won't be too shocking üëª üòÖ.

> **Warning**
> On the first launch the ungzipped artifact I saw the following pop up
> "Mac cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer" 
> If you are fine with that you can `Control-click` the artifact, then choose `Open` from the shortcut menu. 
> Click `Open`. The utility will be saved as an exception to your security settings, 
> and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.
