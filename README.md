## Motivation
An idea of writing this utility originates from Robin Moffatt's [tweet](https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1659214185220423685).

## Usage
### Docker image
üê≥ `excalidocker` is available as a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/etolbakov/excalidocker/tags).
Convert docker-compose files without hassle. Use it in Github actions for documentation, presentations, ADRs what have you 
The sky is the limit. Get the latest image from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/etolbakov/excalidocker): 
```sh
docker pull etolbakov/excalidocker
```
Usage example:
 ```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/data/compose/:/tmp/" -e INPUT_PATH=/tmp/docker-compose.yaml etolbakov/excalidocker:latest > produced-by-image.excalidraw
```
The `produced-by-image.excalidraw` file could be opened in [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) and .... hopefully it won't be too scary üëª üòÖ.

<details>
  <summary>Command with config</summary>
  
  The command below shows how to pass the custom config file

  ```sh
   docker run --rm \ 
   -v "$(pwd)/data/compose/:/tmp/" \
   -v "$(pwd)/excalidocker-config.yaml:/tmp/excalidocker-config.yaml" \
   -e INPUT_PATH=/tmp/docker-compose.yaml \
   -e CONFIG_PATH=/tmp/excalidocker-config.yaml \
   etolbakov/excalidocker:latest > produced-by-image-config-deps.excalidraw
  ```
</details>

More command examples are in the [Makefile](/Makefile).

### Artefact
üìö Download the latest artifact from [releases](https://github.com/etolbakov/excalidocker-rs/releases) and ungzip it.

To get the `help` menu use:
```sh
./excalidocker -h
```
The output should be similar to:
```sh
Utility to convert docker-compose into excalidraw

Usage: excalidocker [OPTIONS] --input-path <INPUT_PATH>

Options:
  -i, --input-path <INPUT_PATH>    file path to the docker-compose.yaml
  -s, --skip-dependencies          display connecting lines between services; if `true` then only service without the lines are rendered
  -o, --output-path <OUTPUT_PATH>  file path for the output excalidraw file. By default the file content is sent to console output
  -c, --config-path <CONFIG_PATH>  config file path for the excalidraw. [default: excalidocker-config.yaml]
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```
Usage example:
```sh
./excalidocker --input-path /your/path/docker-compose.yaml --output-path /your/path/result.excalidraw
```

> **Warning**
>
> On the first launch the ungzipped artifact I saw the following pop up
> "Mac cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
> If you are fine with that you can `Control-click` the artifact, then choose `Open` from the shortcut menu.
> Click `Open`. The utility will be saved as an exception to your security settings,
> and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.

### Config file üé®
`excalidocker` supports basic customization provided via file, for example [excalidocker-config.yaml](./excalidocker-config.yaml).
At the moment it's possible to customize:
 - font size
 - fill type (`hachure`, `cross-hatch`, `solid`) 
 - backgroud colours for services and ports
 - edge type (`sharp`, `round`)
 - enable/disable connections (has the same effect as `--skip-dependencies` cli option)


## Installation
To build `excalidocker` locally, please follow these steps:

1. Install Rust and Cargo if you haven't already. Refer to the official Rust documentation for [installation instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install):
2. Clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/etolbakov/excalidocker-rs.git
```
3. Build the project using Cargo:
```sh
cd excalidocker-rs && cargo build --release
```
There is the `make r` command available in the [Makefile](/Makefile) along with other useful command shortcuts.

## Roadmap
These are the features that I would like to add at some point:
- üìä visualize more data from a docker-compose file - volumes, network, etc
- ü¶Ä various code improvements/enhancements. Feel free to review/suggest if anything could be done better!
- üë®‚Äçüíª etc
